</p>

## User Story
<p>
Having been given a demonstration of the user requirements, a work hours, single day scheduler is needed. This is to have the html and javascript created from scratch, with some css styling provided.
The requirement involved providing the user with the ability to enter tasks as text into hourly timeslots (9-5) in a day scheduler, saving any changes made.
The scheduler only shows the current day, with any data from the previous day lost. The timeslots need to be colour coded to indicate to the user if the current hour is after (grey), within (red) or before (green) each timeslot.
